I've  been always passionate about software development.  I've joined Code Your Future to become a Full Stack developer, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, version control, Github, React, Node JS, and PostgreSQL for the past 10 months. Using the aforementioned technologies, I have created fully functional websites. Along with the technical skills, I have also improved my teamwork, communication, and time management skills.
